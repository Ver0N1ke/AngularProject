# Venues in Amsterdam

Hello and welcome to your first Angular experience! @microHoffman has a challenge for you - create an app that displays venues in Amsterdam. Let's discuss the requirements in more details.

## Required views

In your app you should implement following views:

1) **Table with list of the venues.** The table should have following columns:
  - name
  - city
  - postcode
  - address
  - start year
  - button with text 'Detail' (this will take you to Venue detail view)

2) **Venue detail** - detailed view of the venue. These information should be visible in the venue detail view:
  - Venue name
  - Images of the venue (if available)
  - Address
  - URL (link to their website)

Design of the venue detail view is left on you and your consideration. It could be separate page, modal, whatever you like and find appealing and useful for user.

3) **Map with venues.** (optional, bonus) Embed a map (Google map, Seznam, whatever you prefer) into your app and highlight there the venues from the JSON.
After clicking on the venue, the venue detail should be opened.

## Development notes
- Final app design is left on you, we trust your visual intuition<3. 
- Feel free to install any additional external package, if needed.
- When you are not sure **about the requirements/task description**, ask @microHoffman.
- If you are not sure about how to do something, what is correct syntax or why is it throwing you some weird errors, ask Google. Iff this does not help, ask @microHoffman then.

### Data about venues
Please use the JSON down below for getting the data about the venues.
You can download the JSON on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/microHoffman/bbc0d6a2b8b5428c2867c495968568bf) and include it into your project.
